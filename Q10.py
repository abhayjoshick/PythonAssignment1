"""Using list conversion

You can update a Python tuple element value by converting the tuple to a list, making the necessary changes,
and then converting it back to a tuple.
Using list conversion

Let’s consider an example:"""

# Original tuple
original_tuple = (10, 20, 30, 40, 50)

# Convert the tuple to a list
tuple_list = list(original_tuple)

# Update a specific element
index_to_update = 2
new_value = 35
tuple_list[index_to_update] = new_value

# Convert the list back to a tuple
updated_tuple = tuple(tuple_list)
print("Original Tuple:", original_tuple)
print("Updated Tuple:", updated_tuple)

#Output

# Original Tuple: (10, 20, 30, 40, 50)

# Updated Tuple: (10, 20, 35, 40, 50)
"""
In this example, we have an original tuple with elements (10, 20, 30, 40, 50). We want to update the element at index 2 to the new value 35. 
To achieve this, we convert the tuple to a list using list(original_tuple). Then, we modify the desired element at the specified index, and 
finally, we convert the list back to a tuple using tuple(tuple_list).

The result is the original tuple and the updated tuple, demonstrating how the specific element has been changed. 
This approach allows you to simulate updating tuple elements, despite their inherent immutability, by temporarily converting them to a mutable list 
and then reverting them back to a tuple.
Using tuple slicing

A clever technique involving tuple slicing allows developers to simulate an update. By creating a new tuple with modified elements and
slices of the original tuple, the desired values can be changed without altering the original tuple. 

Let’s illustrate this with an example:"""

# Original tuple
original_tuple = (10, 20, 30, 40, 50)

# Update a specific element using tuple slicing
index_to_update = 2
new_value = 35
updated_tuple = original_tuple[:index_to_update] + (new_value,) + original_tuple[index_to_update + 1:]

print("Original Tuple:", original_tuple)
print("Updated Tuple:", updated_tuple)

#Output:

#Original Tuple: (10, 20, 30, 40, 50)

#Updated Tuple: (10, 20, 35, 40, 50)

"""In this example, the original tuple (10, 20, 30, 40, 50) needs an update at index 2 with the new value 35. 
Tuple slicing is employed to create a new tuple. The original_tuple[:index_to_update] extracts elements before the specified index,
(new_value,) introduces the updated element, and original_tuple[index_to_update + 1:] retrieves elements after the updated index. 
The result is an updated tuple without modifying the original.

This approach is advantageous when dealing with scenarios where immutability is crucial, and the need for an updated tuple arises.
It ensures the integrity of the original tuple while providing a modified version with the desired changes.
Packing and unpacking

In Python, packing and unpacking refer to the process of combining multiple values into a tuple (packing) or extracting values from a tuple (unpacking). Leveraging these concepts provides an elegant way to update specific elements within a tuple.

Let’s illustrate this with an example:"""

# Original tuple
original_tuple = (10, 20, 30, 40, 50)

# Unpack the tuple into individual variables
first, second, third, fourth, fifth = original_tuple

# Update a specific element
index_to_update = 2
new_value = 35

# Create a new tuple with the updated value
updated_tuple = (first, second, new_value, fourth, fifth)

print("Original Tuple:", original_tuple)
print("Updated Tuple:", updated_tuple)

"""

In this example, the original tuple (10, 20, 30, 40, 50) is unpacked into individual variables. The element at index 2 is then updated to the new value 35. By creating a new tuple with the modified value and the unchanged variables, an updated tuple is formed without altering the original.

This approach showcases the power of packing and unpacking in Python, providing an expressive and concise way to handle tuple updates. It emphasizes readability and ease of maintenance, making the code both efficient and elegant."""
